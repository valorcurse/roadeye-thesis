\samenvatting

Nearly everyone carries a smartphone around nowadays. These devices offer a variety of possibilities to tackle a multitude of problems. One of those problems is the difficulty law enforcement faces when trying to find stolen vehicles. This might be solved by crowd-sourcing information gathering in the form of parsing license plates' information using a smartphone's camera coupled with a computer vision algorithm. Using this idea, this thesis is the result of research on the practicability of recognizing license plates using such a device and how to implement such software.
